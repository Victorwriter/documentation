# Introduction

Good visibility and understanding of how traffic moves though your infrastructure is extremely critical to any Network Operations Center \(NOC\) and Security Operations Center \(SOC\) yet there are many approaches. Some are easy, some are hard, some are expensive and some are free.

FMADIO 10G 40G 100G Packet Capture systems combined with Open Source software enables a new kind of visibility and monitoring capabilities using our full packet capture systems. Our packet capture systems are multipurpose, used for troubleshooting, deep dives with Wireshark but also excellent monitoring capabilities!

FMADIO developed pcap2json utility which converts a PCAP into ElasticSearch bulk upload JSON, it even uploads fully compressed JSON directly into ElasticSearch without LogStash. Its free and OpenSource on GitHub, and can use any PCAP file.
