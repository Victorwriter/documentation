# Alerts

#### FW Version: 7135+

Alerts can be generated by system automatically either

* EMail alerts
* Syslog alerts
* SNMP Traps

Alert configuration file is located in&#x20;

```
/opt/fmadio/etc/alert.lua
```

## Triggers

System has can trigger an a small but well defined list of critical Events. The following is a description and example for each item. Triggers are enabled or disabled in the following part of the configuration file. Each line enables/disabled or puts a threshold on the trigger

```
["AlertList"] =
{
    LinkState           = true,
    CaptureState        = true,
    ByteCache           = 1e12,
    BytesOverflow       = true,
    PacketError         = true,
    PacketDrop          = true,
    DiskFreeStore0      = 1e9,
    DiskFreeStore1      = 0,
    DiskFreeRemote0     = 0,
    DiskSMART           = true,
    DiskError           = true,
    Sleep               = 60,
}
```

Each trigger is described below.

### LinkState (Capture Port State)

Monitoring the capture link status is critical to ensure no data is lost. Enabling this option will alert when a capture link goes up or down.

#### **Config**

```
 LinkState       = true, 
```

#### **SYSLOG**

```
2021.07.05-07:53:49.790767 (+09:00) | fmadio20n40v3-363 | local7.alert    | fmadio    | Alert     Capture Link Cap2 State Change 1 -> 0
```

#### SNMP

```
fmadioCapture0Link
fmadioCapture1Link
fmadioCapture2Link
fmadioCapture3Link
fmadioCapture4Link
fmadioCapture5Link
fmadioCapture6Link
fmadioCapture7Link
```

### CaptureState&#x20;

Capture State shows the capture is active or in-active. When using in alert mode it will trigger anytime the capture state changes

#### Config

```
CaptureState    = true,
```

#### SYSLOG

```
2021.12.25-14:33:24.849212 (+09:00) | fmadio20v3-287 | local7.alert    | fmadio    | Alert     Capture State Change 0 -> 1
```

#### SNMP

```
fmadioCaptureEnable
```

### **Bytes Cached**

Bytes Cached indicates how much capture data has been written to SSD, but not written back into long term storage yet. e.g. Its the delta between the capture SSD rate, and the HDD magnetic storage writeback. Trigger on for example 3TB here provides a good indication the HDD writeback process is running too slow for the sustained incoming capture rate.

#### **Config**

&#x20;(example trigger once Cache goes overt 1TB)

```
 ByteCache       = 1e12,  
```

#### **SYSLOG**

```
2021.07.05-07:39:40.545686 (+09:00) | fmadio20n40v3-363 | local7.alert    | fmadio    | Alert     Bytes Cache Threadhold detected 4.000 GB (limit 1.000 G
```

#### SNMP

```
fmadioCaptureCache
```

### BytesOverflow (trigger)

Any time Bytes Over increases an alert is generated. This typically a symptom of capture rates being too high, or HDD writeback too slow (or failing)

#### **Config**

```
   BytesOverflow   = true,
```

#### **SYSLOG**

```
2021.07.05-08:08:01.038273 (+09:00) | fmadio20n40v3-363 | local7.alert    | fmadio    | Alert     Bytes Overflow detected 3000000000 (prev:0)
```

#### SNMP

```
fmadioCaptureOverflow
```

### **PacketError**&#x20;

Counts FCS errors received on the interface. Any time packet error counts changes an alert is generated. Typically occurs when there are Layer1 link stability issues

#### **Config**

```
  PacketError     = true,  
```

#### **SYSLOG**

```
2021.07.05-08:09:51.481888 (+09:00) | fmadio20n40v3-363 | local7.alert    | fmadio    | Alert     Packet FCS Erors detected 0 (prev:1)
```

#### SNMP

```
fmadioCaptureError
```

### **PacketDrop**

Alerts generated when packets are dropped on the capture device.&#x20;

#### **Config**

```
PacketDrop      = true,
```

#### **SYSLOG**

```
2021.07.05-08:09:51.483071 (+09:00) | fmadio20n40v3-363 | local7.alert    | fmadio    | Alert     Packet Capture Drop detected 2 (prev:0)
```

#### SNMP

```
fmadioCaptureDrop
```

### **DiskFreeStore0**

When space on /mnt/store0 partition is less than this amount (scientific notation) in bytes. Alerts are generated.&#x20;

In the below example, an alert is generated when less than 4e9 (4GB) of space is free on /mnt/store0 partition

#### **Config**

```
    DiskFreeStore0  = 4e9,
```

#### **SYSLOG**

```
2021.07.05-08:32:10.876238 (+09:00) | fmadio20n40v3-363 | local7.alert    | fmadio    | Alert     /mnt/store0 disk space low. Free 7160.188GB (7160188243968B) [Threshold 10000.000GB]
```

#### SNMP

```
fmadioDiskFreeStore0
```

### **DiskFreeStore1**

When space on /mnt/store1 (scratch analytics workspace) is less than this amount (scientific notation) in bytes an Alert is generated

#### **Config**

```
 DiskFreeStore1    = 10e9,  
```

#### SYSLOG

```
2021.07.05-08:32:10.876238 (+09:00) | fmadio20n40v3-363 | local7.alert    | fmadio    | Alert     /mnt/store1 disk space low. Free 7160.188GB (7160188243968B) [Threshold 10000.000GB]
```

#### SNMP

```
fmadioDiskFreeStore1
```

### **DiskFreeRemote0**

When space on the /mnt/remote0 (typically NFS mount partition) is less than this threshold an Alert is generated

#### **Config**

```
 DiskFreeRemote0    = 10e9,  
```

#### **SYSLOG**

```
2021.07.05-08:32:10.876238 (+09:00) | fmadio20n40v3-363 | local7.alert    | fmadio    | Alert     /mnt/remote0 disk space low. Free 7160.188GB (7160188243968B) [Threshold 10000.000GB]
```

#### SNMP

```
fmadioDiskFreeRemote0
```

### **DiskError**

Alerts when there is a disk error or RAID error on the device. For example a disk has been lost or HDD RAID redundancy has been reduced.

#### **Config**

```
 DiskError       = true,   
```

#### **SYSLOG**

```
2021.07.05-08:05:34.224665 (+09:00) | fmadio20n40v3-363 | local7.alert    | fmadio    | Alert     Disk/Cache/RAID Error State 3 (prev:0)
```

#### SNMP

```
fmadioDiskSMART
```

### DiskSMART

Alerts on the total number of disk SMART errors. The value is aggregated across all disks, please check the system log files for more details about which specific disk is having an issue.

#### Config

```
DiskSMART      = true,
```

#### SYSLOG

```
2021.07.05-08:05:34.224665 (+09:00) | fmadio20n40v3-363 | local7.alert    | fmadio    | Alert     Disk[0] SMART dError: 1 Total Errors 1
```

#### **SNMP**

```
fmadioDiskSMART
```

### **Sleep**

Minimum number of seconds between alert generation. This is to prevent spamming of alerts due to unexpected system conditions.



## SYSLOG Alerts

Alert events are always output to SYSLOG regardless of the other transport modes (email/snmp etc)

SYSLOG logfile is found in

```
/mnt/store0/messages
```

An example syslog alerts as follows.

```
2021.05.24-17:44:20.001457 (+09:00) | fmadio20v3-287 | local7.alert    | fmadio    | Alert     /mnt/store0 disk space low. Free 60.127GB (60127121408B) [Threshold 100.000GB]
2021.05.24-17:44:20.002903 (+09:00) | fmadio20v3-287 | local7.alert    | fmadio    | Alert     /mnt/store1 disk space low. Free 895.712GB (895712038912B) [Threshold 1000.000GB]
2021.05.24-17:44:25.444418 (+09:00) | fmadio20v3-287 | local7.alert    | fmadio    | Alert     /mnt/store0 disk space low. Free 60.127GB (60126965760B) [Threshold 100.000GB]
2021.05.24-17:44:25.446463 (+09:00) | fmadio20v3-287 | local7.alert    | fmadio    | Alert     /mnt/store1 disk space low. Free 895.712GB (895712038912B) [Threshold 1000.000GB]

```

## EMAIL Alerts

Email alerts can be setup as the following, please add the \["Email"] section in the alet configuration file&#x20;

```
/opt/fmadio/etc/alert.lua
```

An example that sends alerts to the address "alerts@fmad.io" is shown below.

```
local L =
{
["Email"] =
{
    Enable  = true,
    To      = "alerts@fmad.io",
    From    = "packet_capture@fmad.io",
}
,
["AlertList"] =
{
    BytesOverflow   = true,
    PacketError     = true,
    PacketDrop      = true,
    DiskFreeStore0  = 4e9,
    Sleep           = 60, 
}
}
return L

```

In addition fmadio packet capture system uses msrtp as the email client, it requires smtp configuration file&#x20;

```
/opt/fmadio/etc/msmtp.rc
```

Example configuration as follows. Please edit to match the email smtp provider

```
defaults
tls on
tls_certcheck off
logfile /mnt/store0/log/msmtp.log
tls_starttls on

account default
host mail.yourserver.com
port 587
auth on
user fmadio@yourserver.com
password <sercrets>

```

## SNMP Broadcast

**FW: 7611+**

FMADIO devices can operate in SNMP Broadcast mode. In this mode the system will periodically broadcast all SNMP counter values at a fixed time interval to an SNMP target.&#x20;

The general configuration file is used for config

```
/opt/fmadio/etc/time.lua
```

Please edit the section titles \["SNMP"]  as follows

```
["SNMP"] =
{
    ["Enable"]       = false,
    ["Trap"]         = false,
    ["Broadcast"]    = true,
    ["BroadcastPeriod"]    = 60e9,
    ["Verbose"]      = false,
    ["ComName"]      = "public",
},

```

&#x20;The above config enables SNMP Broadcast mode only, while SNMP Trap(Alert) mode is disabled. Broadcast frequency is 60e9 nanoseconds, e.g. every 1 minute.&#x20;

Broadcast and Trap mode can be use simultaneously if required.

Example output in broadcast mode is as follows, from the /mnt/store0/log/monitor\_alert.cur logfile

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (120).png>)

This translates to

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (124).png>)

#### Troubleshooting

Logfiles are found /mnt/store0/log/monitor\_alert.cur

Verbose mode above can be set to "true" to allow additional logging.
