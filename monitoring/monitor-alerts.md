# Alerts

#### FW Version: 7135+

Alerts can be generated by system automatically either

* EMail alerts
* Syslog alerts

Configuration file is located in 

```text
/opt/fmadio/etc/alert.lua
```

### SYSLOG Alerts

An example configuration file with alert via syslog, please see the Triggers section below for description of each alert type.

```text
local L =
{
["AlertList"] =
{
    BytesOverflow   = true,
    PacketError     = true,
    PacketDrop      = true,
    DiskFreeStore0  = 4e9,
    DiskFreeStore1    = 1000e9,
    DiskFreeRemote0   = 10e9,
    Sleep           = 60,                           -- how long to sleep when an alert is triggered. prevents flodding
}
}
return L

```

The above example will generate syslog alerts as follows. Syslog alerts are always enabled

```text

```

### EMAIL Alerts

Email alerts can be setup as the following, please add the "Email" section in the configuration file

```text
local L =
{
["Email"] =
{
    Enable  = true,
    To      = "alerts@fmad.io",
    From    = "packet_capture@fmad.io",
}
,
["AlertList"] =
{
    BytesOverflow   = true,
    PacketError     = true,
    PacketDrop      = true,
    DiskFreeStore0  = 4e9,
    Sleep           = 60, 
}
}
return L

```

In addition fmadio packet capture system uses msrtp as the email client, it requires smtp configuration file 

```text
/opt/fmadio/etc/msmtp.rc
```

Example configuration as follows. Please edit to match the email smtp provier

```text
defaults
tls on
tls_certcheck off
logfile /mnt/store0/log/msmtp.log
tls_starttls on

account default
host mail.yourserver.com
port 587
auth on
user fmadio@yourserver.com
password <sercrets>

```

## Triggers

System has can trigger an a small but well defined list of critical Events. The following is a description and example for each item

## BytesOverflow

Any time Bytes Over increases an alert is generated. This typically a symptom of capture rates being too high, or HDD writeback too slow \(or failing\)

**Config**:

```text
   BytesOverflow   = true,
```

**Example:**

```text
2021.07.05-08:08:01.038273 (+09:00) | fmadio20n40v3-363 | local7.alert    | fmadio    | Alert     Bytes Overflow detected 3000000000 (prev:0)
```

## **PacketError**

Counts FCS errors received on the interface. Any time packet error counts changes an alert is generated. Typically occurs when there are Layer1 link stability issues

**Config**Example:

```text
  PacketError     = true,  
```

**Example:**

```text
2021.07.05-08:09:51.481888 (+09:00) | fmadio20n40v3-363 | local7.alert    | fmadio    | Alert     Packet FCS Erors detected 0 (prev:1)
```

## **PacketDrop**

Alerts generated when packets are dropped on the capture device. 

**Config**:

```text
PacketDrop      = true,
```

**Example:**

```text
2021.07.05-08:09:51.483071 (+09:00) | fmadio20n40v3-363 | local7.alert    | fmadio    | Alert     Packet Capture Drop detected 2 (prev:0)
```

## **DiskFreeStore0**

When space on /mnt/store0 partition is less than this amount \(scientific notation\) in bytes. Alerts are generated. 

In the below example, an alert is generated when less than 4e9 \(4GB\) of space is free on /mnt/store0 partition

**Config:**

```
    DiskFreeStore0  = 4e9,
```

**Example:**:

```text
2021.07.05-08:32:10.876238 (+09:00) | fmadio20n40v3-363 | local7.alert    | fmadio    | Alert     /mnt/store0 disk space low. Free 7160.188GB (7160188243968B) [Threshold 10000.000GB]
```

## **DiskFreeStore1**

When space on /mnt/store1 \(scratch analytics workspace\) is less than this amount \(scientific notation\) in bytes an Alert is generated

**Config::**

```text
 DiskFreeStore1    = 10e9,  
```

**Example:**

```text
2021.07.05-08:32:10.876238 (+09:00) | fmadio20n40v3-363 | local7.alert    | fmadio    | Alert     /mnt/store1 disk space low. Free 7160.188GB (7160188243968B) [Threshold 10000.000GB]
```

## **DiskFreeRemote0**

When space on the /mnt/remote0 \(typically NFS mount partition\) is less than this threshold an Alert is generated

**Config:**

```text
 DiskFreeRemote0    = 10e9,  
```

**Example:**

```text
2021.07.05-08:32:10.876238 (+09:00) | fmadio20n40v3-363 | local7.alert    | fmadio    | Alert     /mnt/remote0 disk space low. Free 7160.188GB (7160188243968B) [Threshold 10000.000GB]
```

## **Disk / RAID Errors**

Alerts when there is a disk error or RAID error on the device. For example a disk has been lost or HDD RAID redundancy has been reduced.

**Config**:

```text
 DiskError       = true,   
```

**Example:**

```text
2021.07.05-08:05:34.224665 (+09:00) | fmadio20n40v3-363 | local7.alert    | fmadio    | Alert     Disk/Cache/RAID Error State 3 (prev:0)
```

## **Bytes Cached Threshold**

Bytes Cached indicates how much capture data has been written to SSD, but not written back into long term storage yet. e.g. Its the delta between the capture SSD rate, and the HDD magnetic storage writeback. Trigger on for example 3TB here provides a good indication the HDD writeback process is running too slow for the sustained incoming capture rate.

**Config::** \(trigger once Cache goes overt 1TB\)

```text
 ByteCache       = 1e9,  
```

**Example:**

```text
2021.07.05-07:39:40.545686 (+09:00) | fmadio20n40v3-363 | local7.alert    | fmadio    | Alert     Bytes Cache Threadhold detected 4.000 GB (limit 1.000 G
```

## Capture Link State

Monitoring the capture link status is critical to ensure no data is lost. Enabling this option will alert when a capture link goes up or down.

**Config**:

```text
 LinkState       = true, 
```

**Example:**

```text
2021.07.05-07:53:49.790767 (+09:00) | fmadio20n40v3-363 | local7.alert    | fmadio    | Alert     Capture Link Cap2 State Change 1 -> 0
```

## **Sleep**

Minimum number of seconds between alert generation. This is to prevent spamming of alerts due to unexpected system conditions.
