Layout of the network ports for FMADIO100G v2 1U Analytics System \(40G QSFP+ Management\)

TBD

**1Gbe Management Ports**

Systems shipped Prior to April 2021, default 1G management port is "L2"

System shipped after April 2021 default 1G management port is "L1"

This was made as L1 port can bridge the IPMI/BMC port \(single RJ45 connection for both Server and BMC\), the L2 port can not bridged. Please contact support@fmad.io on how to swap.
